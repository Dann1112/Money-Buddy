# Money-Buddy

I've been using a system to have control over my money and how I spend it.

This has helped me a lot to understand how much I've spent in stuff that it's not absolutely necessary.
In my case, Junk Food is a great topic to talk about, and I realized that I was spending most of my money on it.
I understood how bad it was for my health so it changed the way I live now. Now I have more money and I spend less on Junk Food.

What I'm trying to say is that, I'm trying to give people an app that could help them have control over their money and maybe learn something
about their spending habits that could change their lives.

This is my very first app, so it might not be the best one, but I'm trying to do my best. I'm learning through the development of this app
so if anyone who is passing by could check out my code and maybe give some piece of advice I'd be glad to hear from them.

Thanks.
